        <summary>
            The vm.Aspects.Security.Cryptography.Ciphers package helps in addressing a common application requirement for achieving confidentiality, integrity and source authentication of
            data-at-rest, data-in-motion, and data-in-use, e.g. for PII (Personally Identifiable Information) fields.

        <description>
            THE CLASSES FROM THE CIPHERS PACKAGES DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANY CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS.
            They leverage the cryptographic algorithms implemented by the .NET cryptographic service providers.
            Features:
            * The package uses industry strong cryptographic algorithms for encryption, hashing and signing included in the .NET framework.
            * It is very easy to integrate with a Dependency Injection containers like Unity oe StructureMap, i.e. the behaviors are abstracted with a handful of simple interfaces.
            * It is very easy to use and configure the objects. Omitted configuration parameters default to sensible defaults.
            * The package does not have dependencies except on the .NET Standard interfaces.
            * Built and tested with .NET Standard 2.0.
            * Documentation: https://github.com/vmelamed/vm/tree/master/Aspects/Security/Cryptography/Ciphers/docs/Ciphers.md.

        <releaseNotes>
            Note: vm.Aspects.Security.Cryptography.Ciphers inherits the code from the Ciphers package but since this is a major non-backwards compatible release,
            changed the name of the package for consistency's sake with the other vm.Aspects packages.

            Now vm.Aspects.Security.Cryptography.Cyphers is dependent on .NET Standard 2.0.

            Refactored the library to drop the dependency on the Common Service Locator (CSL) - no assumption of DI container anymore.

            Refactored a number of c-tors to take additional dependencies, which were previously resolved from the CSL.

            To minimize the dependency of the package on non-.NET Standard packages (extension packages) split the package in three:
            the current vm.Aspects.Security.Cryptography.Ciphers, vm.Aspects.Security.Cryptography.Ciphers.Xml and vm.Aspects.Security.Cryptography.Ciphers.ProtectedData

            Dropped the utility tools from the package but they are still maintained on a source level and can be downloaded, built and run.

            Refactored the tools to use CommandLineParser.

            Combined all key management tools in one - KeyFile.

            Added the tool FileCrypt that can encrypt and decrypt files (for more information run &quot;FileCrypt help&quot; or &quot;FileCrypt help encrypt&quot; or &quot;FileCrypt help decrypt&quot;)
