        <summary>
            Easy to integrate and easy to use component that dumps the value of an arbitrary .NET object in a easy to read text form.
            Helpful for debugging and logging purposes.
        </summary>

            Features:
            * The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface
            * The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
            * For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties
            * The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented
            * Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
            * Handles circular references
            * The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
            - the order in which the properties are dumped
            - formatting of the property names and/or values
            - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties
            - masking the values of sensitive properties (e.g. PII)
            - the depth of the recursion into complex members
            - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties
            * The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute
            * Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes
            * Built and tested with .NET 4.6.2, 4.7.1, 4.7.2

        <releaseNotes>
            Note that this package derives from the package AspectObjectDumper v.1.10.2 where I removed the dependency on the Common Service Locator.
            Technically this is a breaking change. However instead of just bumping the major version, I decided to also go a step further
            and rename the package to vm.Aspects.Diagnostics.ObjectTextDumper for consistency with all vm.Aspects.* packages and libraries out there.

            This is a breaking change only for clients who have their own implementation of vm.Aspects.Diagnostics.IMemberInfoComparer registered in a
            Common Service Locator compatible DI container. As a result, if clients need to implement their own member comparer, they can pass a reference to it in the constructor of ObjectTextDumper object.
